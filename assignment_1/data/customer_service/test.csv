Agent: No, the quality of the wristwatch is the same, regardless of the seller. However, the shipping time and location may vary, depending on the seller. If you choose to purchase the wristwatch from the $50 seller, it may take longer to receive the product due to the shipping location.

Customer: Okay, I understand that. Is there any discount available for the wristwatch from the primary seller?

Agent: Yes, we do offer discounts on some of our products. Let me check if there are any available for the wristwatch you are interested in. Please hold on for a moment.
