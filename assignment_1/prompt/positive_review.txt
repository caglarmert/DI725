This place was DELICIOUS!! My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's \"25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\" and he's usually pretty accurate. His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich. We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away. The staff is extremely friendly. My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich. The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for! Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people. On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable. The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50. Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal. We will definitely be back!!! Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY. So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well. And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.
